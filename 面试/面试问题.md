1. 自我介绍
我叫 XXX，目前是一名从事 C++ 软件开发的工程师（或正在积极寻找 C++ 开发岗位）。我本科和研究生专业都是计算机相关，在学校期间我打下了扎实的编程基础，研究生期间主要关注的是 XXXX（项目/课题方向）。工作中我主要使用 C++ 进行 XXX 模块的开发，涉及 STL、内存管理、多线程编程等内容。业余时间我也持续学习现代 C++（如 C++11/14/17）和算法优化。

English:
My name is XXX. I’m currently a C++ software engineer (or actively looking for a position in C++ development). I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science. During my academic years, I built a solid foundation in programming and focused on [your research area] during graduate school. In my work, I primarily use C++ to develop [modules/systems], involving STL, memory management, and multithreading. I’m also committed to continuously improving my skills in modern C++ standards and algorithm optimization in my spare time.

2. 每段经历的动机，比如读书，某份工作的选择
我选择计算机专业是因为我从高中时期就对编程产生了兴趣。在大学期间，我意识到软件开发不仅是逻辑的挑战，也是创造性的过程，因此选择继续攻读研究生来深入掌握底层原理。在找工作时，我选择了 [公司名]，因为它提供了我想要的 C++ 技术栈和嵌入式/算法相关方向，与我长期的发展目标一致。

English:
I chose Computer Science because I developed a strong interest in programming during high school. In college, I realized software development is not only intellectually challenging but also creatively fulfilling. That motivated me to pursue a Master’s degree to deepen my understanding of computer systems. When choosing my first job, I joined [company] because it offered opportunities to work with the C++ tech stack and areas like embedded systems/algorithms, which aligned well with my long-term goals.

3. 研究生毕业到工作之间的gap原因
我毕业之后有一段时间没有马上进入职场，主要原因是我希望先系统整理一下我的知识体系，并且考虑清楚我职业发展的方向。同时我也利用这段时间自学了现代 C++ 标准、参与了开源项目/做了一些个人项目，为正式进入行业做准备。

English:
After graduating, I took some time before entering the workforce. During this gap, I focused on consolidating my knowledge base and carefully considering the direction I wanted to take in my career. I also used the time to study modern C++ standards, contribute to open-source projects / build some personal projects, and prepare myself technically and mentally for the industry.


4. 如何评价自己的c++水平，并且justify
我认为自己在 C++ 上属于中高级水平。我熟悉 C++98/03 的基础语法，也能熟练使用 C++11/14 的一些现代特性，如 auto、lambda 表达式、智能指针、RAII、move 语义等。我掌握 STL 各种容器的原理和使用，了解常见的设计模式和内存管理技巧。在实际项目中，我独立完成过 XXX 的 C++ 模块开发，代码风格注重安全性和可维护性。

English:
I would rate my C++ skills as intermediate to advanced. I’m solid with the fundamentals of C++98/03 and familiar with modern C++ features such as auto, lambda expressions, smart pointers, RAII, and move semantics from C++11/14. I have a good understanding of STL containers, memory management, and common design patterns. In my previous projects, I independently developed C++ modules for [specific system/project], with an emphasis on code safety and maintainability.

5. 对理想工作的预期
我理想的工作是能持续使用和提升 C++ 技术的岗位，最好能接触到底层开发、算法优化或高性能计算这类方向。同时我希望加入一个技术氛围浓厚、团队协作良好、能够互相学习成长的环境。

English:
My ideal job is one that allows me to continuously work with and deepen my skills in C++, preferably in areas like low-level development, algorithm optimization, or high-performance computing. I’m also looking for a team with a strong technical culture, good collaboration, and opportunities for mutual learning and growth.

6. 工作的No-go
我不太倾向于那些没有代码质量要求、技术债严重或者完全不使用现代 C++ 的团队。此外，如果一个职位完全与我的专业技能脱节，比如偏业务流程配置的工作，我会慎重考虑。

English:
I generally avoid environments where code quality is not valued, there’s excessive technical debt, or modern C++ practices are ignored. I would also be cautious about roles that are far removed from my core technical strengths—for example, positions that focus mainly on configuration or business process tools rather than development.

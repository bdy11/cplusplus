single responsibility

oepn/close principle
open to extension, closed to modification

liskov substitution principle
derived class object should be able to replace base class object, without change the behavior of the programm

inteface segregation principle
should not force a class to implement a method that it do not use


dependency inversion principle
高层模块不应该依赖低层模块，二者都应该依赖于抽象。抽象不应该依赖于细节，细节应该依赖于抽象。
说白了就是多用接口和抽象类来解耦具体实现。
